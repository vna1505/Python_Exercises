#Given an integer n, create a two-dimensional array of size (n×n) and populate it as follows, with spaces between each character:
#The positions on the minor diagonal (from the upper right to the lower left corner) receive 1 .
#The positions above this diagonal recieve 0 .
#The positions below the diagonal receive 2 .
#Print the elements of the resulting array.

    a[i][n - i - 1] = 1
for i in range(n):

        a[i][j] = 2
for row in a:
    for elem in row:
        print(elem, end=' ')
    print()
